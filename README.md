# BruteForceSSH
Simple SSH bruteforcer with a basic and colorful interface. The SSH connection is made via the paramiko module. This little script is entirely coded by me, so it is not necessarily optimized, it was a simple project.

# Requirements
- You need to install the paramiko module, to install it type : `pip install paramiko`
- You need also to install socks module, to install it type : `pip install socks`

# How used it
- You need to add your password wordlist in the `wordlist.txt` file. 
- Launch the application with `python BruteForceSSH.py` then enter the requested information of your target. 
I clearly specify that I am in no way responsible for your actions and that I offer this tool developed by me for educational purposes only.
